# Java 8 New Features:

1. The main objective of java 8 is to enable functional programming in java so that just like another languages we can able to write very less code to do more things.

2. So whatever functional programming benifits are there now we can enjoy those benifits in java also because of lambda expression concepts.

3. There are several feature of java 8 but the biggest advantage is we can write concise code we are not required to write big big code.  

## Calculate sqrt using normal java programming:

    class Test
    {
        public static int squreIt(int n)
        {
                return n*n
        }
    
        public static void mian(String args[])
        {
       
                System.out.println("The squre of 4 is"+squreIt(4));
                System.out.println("The squre of 8 is"+squreIt(8    ));
       
        }
    }
